Dear BarCode participants, 
Our session on Friday will be mostly interactive, which means we will also be writing code and using different tools. ðŸ˜‰
To make sure everyone has the same prerequisites, I ask you to install the PyCharm IDE. You can find the instructions by following the link: [PyCharm installation instructions](https://github.com/martinoz1024/SE-workshop/blob/main/PyCharme%20Installation%20Guide.pdf)
